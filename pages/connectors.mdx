# Connectors

On this page we will be having a look at the different types of monitor connectors (aka cables),
which is how data is transferred between the computer and the monitor.
We will look at when they were first introduced and what resolutions and refresh rates
(this is the amount of times the picture on the screen changes per second) they are capable of, measured in Hertz.

## VGA

The first connector that we will be looking at is _Video Graphics Adapter_ (VGA).
This cable was first introduced by IBM in 1987.
The disadvantage of VGA is that it can only handle a resolution of 640 x 480 and only at a refresh rate of 60hz (_HP, 2019_ [^1]).
The low resolution and refresh rate is due to VGA's use of analogue signals (_History Computer, 2021_ [^2]).

## DVI

The first DVI cable came into use in 1999.
DVI stands for _Digital Visual Interface_ and is capable of resolutions up to 1920 x 1080 and a refresh rate of up to 144hz.
This is a major advantage as it allows for a smoother and more attractive viewing experience.
There is also three different types of DVI cables DVI-A (analogue only), DVI-D (digital only) and DVI-I (both), (_History Computer, 2021_ [^2]).

## HDMI

HDMI cables were first made in 2002 (_HDMI_ [^5]).
HDMI stands for _High Definition Multimedia Interface_.
The advantage of HDMI cables is that they are capable of transferring high quality audio and video, resolutions up to 8k and refresh rated of 240hz which will lead to a better viewing experience (_Techreviewer, 2022_ [^6]).

## Comparison

| Cable    | Refresh rate | Resolution  |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **VGA**  | 60hz         | 640 x 480   |
| **DVI**  | 144hz        | 2560 x 1440 |
| **HDMI** | 240hz        | 7680 x 4320 |
