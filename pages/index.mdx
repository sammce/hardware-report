# Monitors

## Overview

A monitor is a piece of computer hardware responsible for showing the user visual information from a computer,
which it is connected to via a cable. These cables will be discussed in <NextLink href="/connectors">Connectors</NextLink>

Monitors are similar to TVs but usually display information at a much higher resolution.
They also typically sit atop a desk rather than connected to a wall.
They are sometimes referred to as screens or displays. (_Lifewire_[^1]).

## History

### CRT

Originally, monitors were made using a _cathode ray tube_ (CRT) to display information,
which involved directing a beam of electrons at a phosphor-coated screen using a magnetic field.

This form of display had its limitations, however, and was replaced by _liquid crystal displays_ (LCD) monitors.
CRT displays consumed more power, were physically larger than LCD displays and had a much lower resolution,
meaning the images they produced looked worse. (_GeeksforGeeks_ [^5])
