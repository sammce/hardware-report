# Monitor Basics

## Overview

A monitor is a piece of computer hardware responsible for showing the user visual information from a computer,
which it is connected to via a cable.

Monitors are similar to TVs but usually display information at a much higher resolution.
They also typically sit atop a desk rather than connected to a wall.
They are sometimes referred to as screens or displays. (_Lifewire_[^1]).

## Resolution

A monitor's resolution refers to the amount of pixels it can display both horizontally and vertically.
For instance, a resolution of 1920x1080 (known more commonly as 1080p) means that the monitor can display 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically.
We'll cover pixels in <NextLink href="/internals">Internals</NextLink>.

## History

### CRT

Originally, monitors were made using a _cathode ray tube_ (CRT) to display information from the computer,
which involved directing a beam of electrons at a phosphor-coated screen using a magnetic field.

This form of display had its limitations, however, and was replaced by _liquid crystal displays_ (LCD) monitors.
CRT displays consumed more power, were physically larger than LCD displays and had a much lower resolution,
meaning the images they produced looked worse (_GeeksforGeeks_ [^5]).
