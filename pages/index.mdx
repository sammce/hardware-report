# Monitor Basics

## Overview

A monitor is a piece of computer hardware responsible for showing the user visual information from a computer,
which it is connected to via a cable.

Monitors are similar to TVs but usually display information at a much higher resolution.
They also typically sit atop a desk rather than connected to a wall.
They are sometimes referred to as screens or displays. (_Lifewire_ [^1]).

## Resolution

A monitor's resolution refers to the amount of pixels it can display both horizontally and vertically.
For instance, a resolution of 1920 x 1080 (known more commonly as 1080p) means that the monitor can display 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically.
We'll cover pixels in <NextLink href="/internals">Internals</NextLink>.

## History

### CRT

Originally, monitors were made using a _cathode ray tube_ (CRT) to display information from the computer,
which involved directing a beam of electrons at a phosphor-coated screen using a magnetic field.

This form of display had its limitations, however, and was replaced by _liquid crystal displays_ (LCD) monitors.
CRT displays consumed more power, were physically larger than LCD displays and had a much lower resolution,
meaning the images they produced looked worse (_GeeksforGeeks_ [^5]).

### Terminal

When the first commercial computers were being released, the human-computer interaction
took place via a CRT based terminal built into the computer, as can be seen below. Throughout the 1990s, LCD displays became
the standard, and the terminal was replaced by the standalone monitor we are familiar with today.
