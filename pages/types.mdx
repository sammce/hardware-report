# Types of Displays

On this page of the project will be having a look at the different types of displays that a monitor can have.

## LCD

All of the types of displays are derived from this technology, they just implement it in different ways.
The liquid crystals in this display don't actually emit light themselves, so this type of display uses a backlight to light up the crystals so that you can see the image (Orient display, 2022 [^1]).

## IPS

IPS is a type of LCD display that stands for In Plane Switching.
This means that all the crystals are aligned so that they are parallel (ViewSonic, 2022 [^3]). This allow for an IPS display to be extremely colour accurate.
An advantage of an IPS display is that they have a low response time (Harding, 2020 [^4]).

## TN

A TN display or a Twisted Nematic display is again a form of LCD technology.
The TN panel works by polarizing light as it enters.
An advantage of the TN display is that it is very cheap to manufacture and has a fast response time (Harding, 2018 [^5]).

## VA

A VA display or a Vertical Alignment display is from the LCD family as well.
This type of display works by having the LCD between two pieces of glass with crystals being naturally vertical without electricity present.
Then when electricity is introduced the crystals go horizontal allowing light to pass through giving you an image (Eizo, 2022 [^6]).
