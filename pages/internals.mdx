# Internals

On this page we will be talking about what parts are inside of the monitor and how they work.

## Pixels

Pixels are the smallest controllable element of a picture displayed on a screen.
Each pixel can produce a colour using different combinations of the colours red, green and blue, known as RGB.
Each RGB value is represented using an 8-bit number, meaning the resulting colour is a 24 bit (3 byte) number,
which is capable of representing $2^{24}$, or 16.7 million colours. (_Wikipedia, 2022_ [^1])

## Backlight

The backlight sits behind the screen and is used to light up the image as LCDs do not light themselves up.
Without the backlight monitors would not be usable when light is present as the image that the display gives off would be too dim (_Wikipedia, 2022_ [^3]).

## Circuit board

The circuit board is what the monitor uses to talk to the computer.
Without this the monitor would not do anything when it is powered on as it would not know how to decipher the computers instructions (_Wikipedia, 2022_ [^5]).

## Connectors

The connectors on the monitor is how the monitor receives the correct information from the computer, covered in <Link href="/connectors">Connectors</Link>.
This is also how the monitor will receives power.
